Model Based System Engineering Project

## Main question 

- Is it possible to build a nationwide semi-autonomous drone delivery system for time-critical goods such as medicine? 

## Simulation Parameters 

- Weight 

- Battery capacity (and charging time between flights) 

- Weather (wind, temperature, air pressure, etc.) 

- GPS Location 

- Fixed locations for drop-off and base station 

- Fixed fleet of drones 

- Charging time 

- Type of drones (quad copters or plane) 

- Cost per kilometre 

- Charging time 

## Assumptions: 

- Collision with other drones or aircrafts is not a worry. 

- Terrain and obstacles are not considered 

- Countries with hard to reach areas need medicine delivery. 

- Drones are refilled and recharged automatically (excluding the human factor) 

- We assume that at the base station there are charged batteries 

## Simulation Engine
- Unity
- C#
